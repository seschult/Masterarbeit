The basic principal behinde the interactions, which are mediated by gauge Bosons, is  that the Lagrange density is invariant under local gauge transformation. More Precisse, the particals are discribed as Fields. The Time and Space evolution of those fields follows the Euler-Lagrange equation which can be determinde using Hamiltions variation Pricipall of minmal Action.

\section{Particals, Forces and Fields}\label{key:SM 2}


The Standard Model of Particle Physics \cite{glashow1961partial,glashow1970weak,gross1973asymptotically,politzer1973reliable,politzer1974asymptotic,salam1964electromagnetic,weinberg1967model} is a relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT), which describes all known elementary particles and fundamental forces, gravity excluded.  It's basic framework, consists of a small number of particles, described as fields $\Psi$ \footnote{In this context, the term particle refers to the excitation of a fieldoperator. }, and symmetry principles. As displayed in \cref{fig:SM}, there are currently three generations of fermions (spin 1/2), distinguishable into quarks and leptons. Each generation consist of a up- and a down-type quark, a charged lepton and the corresponding light neutrino. Measurements of the Z-boson decay width could only confirm the existence of three light neutrino species \cite{schael2006aleph}. 

Despite there are more than one generation of fundamental Fermions, all known observable matter is just mad from the first one, concluding that members of the higher fermion generations are unstable.

The Standard Modell of Partical Physics , is a re-normalizable and relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT) of the fundamental fermions (spin $s =1/2$) and their interactions mediated by gauge bosons (spin $s = 1$).  It is based on a small number of particles and symmetry principles. Basically, as shown in \cref{fig:SM}, there are three fermion generations. Each of them consists of  a up- and a down type quark, a charged lepton and a corresponding light neutrino. \\ 

It's basic structure is depicted in   , with three generations of fermions (quarks and leptons), of which each conists of a up- and a down type quark, a charged lepton and a corresponding neutrino.  The existence of further heavy  generation of up- and down-type has been exluded as for Mt and Mb wit 95 CL.
Additionally the mass of a possible 4th lepton generation is limmited by the mass of the Z boson, and its lifetime Measuremntes confirms only three light neutrion generatis. \\ 





In the theory the particles are described as fields $\psi$, which follow

Local gauge invariance requires the Standard Model Lagrangian to remain invariant when transforming the fermion fields in the following manner:
ψ → ψ exp(−iα j(x) f j). (2.1)
This principle is only valid in the presence of (massless) fields which transform in the same manner as the fermion fields thus compensating the fermion field transformations in each point of space and time. Based on the choice of the local gauge symmetry group the strong and electroweak interaction theories emerge - introducing a set of bosonic particles intermediating the corresponding forces. Following Noether’s theorem, each symmetry group introduces field-charges which are conserved under local gauge transfromation.
